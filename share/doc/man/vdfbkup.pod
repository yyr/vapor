=head1 NAME

vdfbkup.pl - Create a backup of a VAPOR Data Collection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<vdfbkup.pl> [options] I<vdffile> I<directory>

B<vdfbkup.pl> [options] I<vdffile> I<command [command args]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<vdfbkup.pl> will make a backup of VAPOR Data Collection (VDC) associated
with the named .vdf file, I<vdffile>.  In the first form of the command
the backup files are written to the named directory. In the second form
of the command, each backup file generated by B<vdfbkup.pl> is passed as
an argument to the user command specified by I<command>. Each occurrence
of the token B<%s> in the command argument list is replaced by the path
to the  B<vdfbkup.pl> backup file.

Files contained in the VDC that are smaller than a threshold are archived
in a tar file. Files that exceed the threshold are backed up directly:
copied, without modification to I<directory> if the first form of the
command is used, or passed as arguments to I<command> if the second form
of B<vdfbkup.pl> is invoked.


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -bs E<lt>block_sizeE<gt>

Specify the blocking factor to be used by the B<tar> command. The
argument, I<block_size> is passed directly to B<tar> as the B<-b>
option argument.

=item -maxarg E<lt>sizeE<gt>

This option specifies the maximum UNIX command line argument length
permitted by the system, in bytes. This option should only be needed
in the event that the UNIX shell limit is unusually restrictive, or if
the VDC contains many, many small files that would otherwise fit into a
single tar archive. Unfortunately there is no portable way to determine
the maximum argument length permitted by a given system.

=item -maxsize E<lt>sizeE<gt>

This option specifies the maximum size in MBs of a single VDC file that will
be placed in a tar archive. Files that are larger than I<size> will be
backed up without placing them in a tar archive.

=item -maxtarsize E<lt>sizeE<gt>

This option specifies the maximum size in MBs of a single tar file that
B<vdfbkup.pl> may genearate. Multiple tar files are generated as needed.

=item -nolog 

Normally B<vdfbkup.pl> creates a manifest listing all of the files backed
up. If this option is specified the manifest will not be generated.

=item -nr 

Echo, but do not execute any commands. This option may be used to see what
files would be backed up by B<vdfbkup.pl> if this option were not present.

=item -quiet 

Operate quietly. Normally, B<vdfbkup.pl> is quite verbose, echoing each
command before executing it.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The command:

=over 4

vdfbkup.pl mydata.vdf /usr/bin/scp %s myremotehost:/remote_directory

=back

would back up the VDC files associated with B<mydata.vdf> to the remote system,
B<myremotehost>, using the B<scp> command.
