=head1 NAME

ncdf2vdf - Convert NetCDF data to VAPOR data 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ncdf2vdf> [options] I<metafile> I<ncdffile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ncdf2vdf>
converts a variable in the named NetCDF data file, I<ncdffile>,
into a variable in the VAPOR Data
Collection (VDC) associated with the named .vdf file, I<metafile>.
The variable name in the VDC must already be specified as either a 2D or 3D variable 
in the associated .vdf file (using e.g. B<vdfedit>, B<vdfcreate>, or B<wrfvdfcreate>).  
The Y dimension of the variable must precede the X dimension in the dimensions
associated with the variable in the NetCDF file.
If a NetCDF dimension is one greater than the corresponding VDC dimension, 
data is averaged to the VDC dimension, to enable conversion of variables on staggered grids.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -debug

Turn on debugging mode. 

=item -quiet

Operate quietly. 

=item -help 

Print a usage statement and then exit.

=item -ts E<lt>timestepE<gt>

Specify the timestep in the VDC that will be converted; default is 0.

=item -varname E<lt>VariableNameE<gt>

Specify the name of the variable in the VDC 

=item -ncdfvar E<lt>ncdfVariableNameE<gt>

Specify the name of the variable in the NetCDF file, if it is not the same as in the VDC.

=item -dimnames E<lt>xdim:ydim:zdimE<gt>

Specify a colon-separated list of the dimension names in the NetCDF file that will be converted to X, Y, and Z dimensions in the VDC.  If the variable is 2D, the Z dimension name is ignored.  The Y dimension
must precede the X dimension in the list of dimensions associated with the variable being converted.

=item -cnstnames E<lt>dim1:dim2:...E<gt>

In a colon-separated list, specify one or more dimension names in the NetCDF file that are held constant for this time step of the variable.  Typically time is a constant dimension name.

=item -cnstvals E<lt>val1:val2:...E<gt>

In a colon-separated list, specify the constant values that will be associated with each associated constant dimension name.   

=item -level E<lt>levE<gt>

Specify the maximum refinement level of the variable that will be written to the VDC.  
By default this is the maximum refinement level of the VDC.  

=item -swapz

If specified, the Z coordinate will be reversed (largest to smallest)
