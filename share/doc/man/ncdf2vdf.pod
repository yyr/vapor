=head1 NAME

ncdf2vdf - Transform netCDF data into a VDC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ncdf2vdf> [options] I<ncdf_ncdf_files...> I<vdffile> 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ncdf2vdf> reads 3D and 2D variables from one or more netCDF files,
wavelet transforms the data, and stores it in the VDC associated
with the .vdf file I<vdffile>. The file I<vdffile> must first be created with 
the command B<ncdfvdfcreate>

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -vars E<lt>varsE<gt>

Variables to convert.  A colon delimited list of the 3D and 2D variables
you wish to transform. Their names must appear in the .vdf file, I<vdffile>.
The default is to convert all time-varying 3D and 2D variables defined in
both the .vdf file and the NetCDF files.

=item -numts E<lt>numberE<gt>

Specify the maximum number of time steps to convert. After converting
B<number> time steps, no further processing will take place.

=item -stagdims E<lt>dimnamesE<gt>

A colon-delimited list specifying the names of any staggered
dimensions.  A "staggered" dimension has dimension one greater than
an unstaggered dimension. Variables defined on staggered grids are
interpolated to unstaggered grids.

=item -startts E<lt>tsE<gt>

Integer offset of first time step in NetCDF files to be converted

=item -timedims E<lt>dimnamesE<gt>

Colon delimited list of time dimension variable names. Any dimension
names listed with this option are considered time dimensions. Data
variables whose slowest varying dimension is named by this option
are considered time varying.

=item -timevars E<lt>varnamesE<gt>

Colon delimited list of time coordinate variables. If this 1D variable
is present, it specfies the time in user-defined units for each time
step.

=item -level E<lt>levelE<gt> 

See raw2vdf (VDC1 only)

=item -lod E<lt>nE<gt> 

See raw2vdf (VDC2 only). 

=item -nthreads E<lt>nE<gt> 

See raw2vdf (VDC2 only). 

=item -help 

Print a usage statement and then exit.

=item -quiet 

Operate quietly, only reporting fatal errors.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Implicit time steps


Assuming the variables in your NetCDF files do not have an explicit 
time dimension  the command:

    ncdfvdfcreate -vars u:v:temp file1.nc file2.nc file3.nc mydata.vdf

will construct a VDF file, B<mydata.vdf> that will contain the B<u>,
B<v>, and B<temp> variable names for all time steps found in the
NetCDF files B<file1.nc>, B<file2.nc>, and B<file3.nc>.  Because no
time dimension is specified the variables are assumed to be implicitly
time varying (the time step is inferred from the postion of the file
containing the variable on the command line).

Once B<mydata.vdf> exists the variables in the NetCDF files can be
transformed with the single command:

    ncdf2vdf -vars u:v:temp file1.nc file2.nc file3.nc mydata.vdf

Alternatively, each of the three NetCDF files may be processed separately:

    ncdf2vdf -vars u:v:temp -starts 0 file1.nc mydata.vdf

    ncdf2vdf -vars u:v:temp -starts 1 file2.nc mydata.vdf

    ncdf2vdf -vars u:v:temp -starts 2 file3.nc mydata.vdf


=head2 Explicit time steps

Assuming that your NetCDF files have an explicit time dimension with
NetCDF dimension name B<times>, the command

    ncdfvdfcreate -timedims times -vars u:v:temp file1.nc file2.nc file3.nc mydata.vdf

will generate an appropriate .vdf file. This example is identical to the 
previous example, except that here the variables
are expected to be explicitly time varying, having their slowest varying
dimension named "times". Once the B<mydata.vdf> file 
has been created the variables
may be transformed with ncdf2vdf using the command:

    ncdf2vdf -timedims times -vars u:v:temp file1.nc file2.nc file3.nc mydata.vdf

to convert all variables at once. If the time dimesion is of length 10
individual files may be processed
by the sequence of commands:

    ncdf2vdf -timedims times -vars u:v:temp -starts 0 file1.nc mydata.vdf

    ncdf2vdf -timedims times -vars u:v:temp -starts 10 file2.nc mydata.vdf

    ncdf2vdf -timedims times -vars u:v:temp -starts 20 file3.nc mydata.vdf

=head2 Time coordinate variable

If in addition to a time dimension, named "times", your NetCDF files 
contain a time
coordinate variable, also named "times" (a one-dimensional variable
dimentioned by "times", and containing monotonically
increasing values), the following command should be used to generate
the .vdf file:

    ncdfvdfcreate -timedims times -timevar times file1.nc file2.nc file3.nc mydata.vdf

Note that the names of the variables were not specified to the 
B<ncdfvdfcreate> command as in the previous examples. In this case all 2D
and 3D time-varying variables present in the NetCDF files will be identified.

All appropriate, detected variables may then be transformed with the command:

    ncdf2vdf -timedims times -timevar times file1.nc file2.nc file3.nc mydata.vdf
