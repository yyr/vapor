=head1 NAME

ncdf2vdf - Transform netCDF data into a VDC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ncdf2vdf> [options] I<ncdf_ncdf_files...> I<vdffile> 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ncdf2vdf> reads 3D and 2D variables from one or more netCDF files,
wavelet transforms the data, and stores it in the VDC associated
with the .vdf file I<vdffile>. The file I<vdffile> should be created with 
the command B<ncdfvdfcreate>

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -vars E<lt>varsE<gt>

Variables to convert.  A colon delimited list of the 3D and 2D variables
you wish to transform. Their names must appear in the .vdf file, I<vdffile>.
The default is to convert all time-varying 3D and 2D variables defined in
both the .vdf file and the NetCDF files.

=item -numts E<lt>numberE<gt>

Specify the maximum number of time steps to convert. After converting
B<number> time steps, no further processing will take place.

=item -stagdims E<lt>dimnamesE<gt>

A colon-delimited list specifying the names of any staggered
dimensions.  A "staggered" dimension has dimension one greater than
an unstaggered dimension. Variables defined on staggered grids are
interpolated to unstaggered grids.

=item -startts E<lt>tsE<gt>

Integer offset of first time step in NetCDF files to be converted

=item -timedims E<lt>dimnamesE<gt>

Colon delimited list of time dimension variable names. Any dimension
names listed with this option are considered time dimensions. Data
variables whose slowest varying dimension is named by this option
are considered time varying.

=item -timevars E<lt>varnamesE<gt>

Colon delimited list of time coordinate variables. If this 1D variable
is present, it specfies the time in user-defined units for each time
step.

=item -level E<lt>levelE<gt> 

See raw2vdf

=item -lod E<lt>nE<gt> 

See raw2vdf (VDC2 only). 

=item -nthreads E<lt>nE<gt> 

See raw2vdf (VDC2 only). 

=item -help 

Print a usage statement and then exit.

=item -quiet 

Operate quietly, only reporting fatal errors.

=head1 EXAMPLES

    ncdfvdfcreate -vars u:v:temp file1.nc file2.nc file3.nc mydata.vdf

will construct a VDF file, B<mydata.vdf> that will contain the B<u>,
B<v>, and B<temp> variable names for all time steps found in the
NetCDF files B<file1.nc>, B<file2.nc>, and B<file3.nc>.  Because no
time dimension is specified the variables are assumed to be implicitly
time varying (have no time dimension).

The command

    ncdfvdfcreate -timedims times -vars u:v:temp file1.nc file2.nc file3.nc mydata.vdf

is identical to the previous example, except that here the variables
are expected to be explicitly time varying, having their slowest varying
dimension named "times".
