=head1 NAME

romsvdfcreate - Generate a VDF metadata file for a ROMS data set

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<romsvdfcreate> [options] I<roms_ncdf_files...> I<roms_grid_file> I<vdffile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<romsvdfcreate> generates a .vdf metafile that defines a VAPOR
Data Collection (VDC) suitable for containing ocean simulation
output from a ROMS model output.  All of the model output NetCDF
filenames must be provided on the command line, followed by one
NetCDF grid filename, and the desired VAPOR (.vdf) file name.  The
grid file must include variables that do not change in time, including
the depth of the ocean, and the variables defining mappings from
the model grid to latitude, latitude, and depth.  The grid file may
also be included in the collection I<roms_netcdf_files>, if it
contains data variables that change in time.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -vars E<lt>varnamesE<gt>

A colon-delimited list of names of 2D and 3D (spatial) data variables
to include in the .vdf file.  In general, the list of variables
should be a subset of the data variables found in the MOM/POP input
files.  If this option is not present the default behavior is to
generate the list of variables from all of the 2D and 3D (spatial)
variables found in any of the MOM/POP netCDF input files.

=item -level E<lt>levelE<gt>

See vdfcreate.

=item -comment E<lt>stringE<gt>

See vdfcreate.

=item -bs E<lt>NXxNYxNZE<gt>

See vdfcreate.

=item -wname E<lt>wave_nameE<gt>

This option is for VDC2 only, see vdfcreate.

=item -cratios E<lt>vectorE<gt>

This option is for VDC2 only, see vdfcreate.

=item -help 

Print a usage statement and then exit.

=head1 EXAMPLES


The command 

    romsvdfcreate -vars u:v:temp roms1.nc roms2.nc roms3.nc romsgrid.nc mydata.vdf

will construct a VDF file, B<mydata.vdf> that will contain the B<u>,
B<v>, and B<temp> variable names for all time steps found in the
ROMS netCDF files B<roms1.nc>, B<roms2.nc>, and B<roms3.nc>.  The
netCDF file B<romsgrid.nc> will contain time-invariant variables
defining the grid.
