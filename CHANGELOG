Vapor Revision History
----------------------
Alpha5 (Release 0.5) 12/9/05
============================

Wavelet coefficient file format has been changed from custom "wb" format to NetCDF.  Either format
can be read by Vapor applications, however raw2vdf and library routines now always write the NetCDF format. 

Previous support for "NumTransforms" (number of coarsening transformations) was
replaced by "NumRefinements" (number of refining transformations).

Support for flow visualization added.  Flow parameters are specified in the "Flow"
tabbed panel.

Primary flow visualization capabilities include:
	Flow can be steady (streamlines) or unsteady (pathlines)
	For unsteady flow calculations, users can prescribe seeding rates as well
		as data sampling rates.
	Flowlines are integrated from the seed point until they exit the current region,
		or until specified integration time has elapsed.
	Flow updating can be automatic (immediate) or manual (refreshed when user requests it)
	Flow seeding uses a rake of either randomly or uniformly spaced seed points,
		from a user-specifed axis aligned region.
	Rake can be positioned interactively in the 3D scene
	Flows can be visualized via tubes, points, or arrows.
	Diameter and sampling rate of geometric shapes can be adjusted by user.
	Color and opacity of flow can be mapped from variables in the data, age, or
		field magnitude
	Streamlines can be integrated forward and backward in time.

Buttons added to the main panel:
	A "rake" button enables rake positioning mode  
	A "magnifying glass" button resets the viewpoint to examine the current region.
	An "eye" button resets the viewpoint to examine the entire data domain. 
	(The eye and magnifying glass buttons replace buttons that have been removed from 
	the viewpoint and region tabs.)

By default the full data domain bounds are shown as white lines.

Histograms (in the DVR panel) are only created when the data is requested, either by enabling a 
renderer or clicking the "Histo" button.

Data ranges for different timesteps and variables are displayed in the transfer function editor, but
the default data range for the editor is the data range of the first time step in the data.

Users can set the environment variable "VAPOR_DEBUG" in order to view diagnostic information in the launch window.

Users can more easily select closely spaced control points in the transfer function editor.  The control point
closest the mouse is always selected, and the selected control point is always shown in front of others.  

Changes have been made to the session saving capability.  Flow state is saved.   However, previous session
save files (from Alpha3) cannot be restored.
	
Alpha3 (Release 0.3) 7/8/05
===========================

New Features
------------

Support for session save and restore capability.

Support for capturing one or a series of images as jpeg file(s).


The DVR panel now has support for separate transfer functions for each
variable

In the DVR transfer function editor, there is a "Histo" button to
refresh the current histogram.

In the DVR panel, transfer functions can be saved and retrieved to/from
the session.

There is a new session parameters panel, in which you can specify: 
	Cache size
    Handling of logfiles, popups for application messages. 
	(including use of stderr for log messages)
    Jpeg image quality

There is a new visualizer features panel, in which you can specify 
(on a per-visualizer basis):
    Visualizer name
    Enablement and position of coordinate axes
    Visualizer background color
    Enablement and color of wireframes to show the full domain and
    subregion bounds.

    Enablement, background color, positioning, and 
	annotation of color scale.

Added IDL interface for 1D Wavelet Lifting functions

Added support for limiting number of transformations saved to .vdf files

Usability improvements
----------------------

In the DVR panel, more horizontal space to the left and right ends of 
the default domain bar, to make it easier to grab with the mouse.

There are buttons in the viewpoint and region panels that switch the 
viewpoint to either a full domain view or a sub-region view.

In the DVR transfer function editor, clicking the left mouse no longer
creates a new control point.  They must be created with the right mouse
menu.


Major Bug Fixes
---------------

Opacity correction enabled for direct volume rendering multiresolution
data

Fixed memory allocation bug in data cache that restricted memory sizes
to 2 GBs
