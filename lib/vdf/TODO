Support for masks

done - Parallel transforms

Support Min/Max & clamp in decompression

done - GetVara support non-block-aligned coords 

Order threaded I/O

Should 'unlimited' dimensions be supported 

VDCNetCDF
--------

Refinement level should be supported for uncompressed variables to
handle uncompressed coordinate variables.  Reading a coordinate
variable (that was not compressed) should do the appropriate averaging
based on the wavelet (symatric vs asymetric)

VDC
---
SetCompressionBlock() should not have to specify wavelet boundary mode

Should the number of time dimensions be restricted to one? Either
way needs to be tested

Not sure what Uniform coordinate variables are actually doing. Their
uniformness is not guaranteed (can be written to), 

Consider moving VDC::GetNumTimeSteps() to VarBase (or doing away with it
entirely - it's redundant).
