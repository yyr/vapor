This directory contains a Windows port of the grib API.
When grib C API is updated the following changes will need to be repeated.
It was constructed from grib_api-1.12.3 as follows:
The source was downloaded to a Mac OSX 10.9.3 (Mavericks).
configure was run with the option --disable-jpeg
Then the code was modified as follows to build on Windows:
Includes of "unistd.h", "sys/time.h","inttypes.h","strings.h" were made contingent on _WINDOWS not being defined.
A few other header files are included when _WINDOWS is defined, such as Windows.h and io.h.
Various unix functions were replaced by Windows equivalents (when _WINDOWS is defined),
Such as rint, ftello, fseeko, access, strcasecmp.
realpath() was not ported (so this code will not convert symbolic links or handle .. or . in paths).
All the above changes can be identified by searching for "_WINDOWS" in the code.
In the flex/bison code, FLOAT was replaced with Float and BYTE was replaced with Byte, to avoid name conflicts.
grib_api.h had all its methods prefixed with "GRIBAPI_API" so these will be exported on Windows.

All fopen calls in the grib code had the mode changed from "r" to "rb".
The directory "share/grib_api/definitions/" was copied over from the Mac installation, and the environment variable "GRIB_DEFINITION_PATH" was defined to that directory.

Most but not all .c and .h files are included in the windows project, but all the files in the src subdirectory are included in this directory.
